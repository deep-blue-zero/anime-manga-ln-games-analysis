# Cast and reconstruction readiness

## Responsibility

Route verified character identities, aliases, evidence/model homes, observed domains, gaps, and project-local readiness without creating global registry records.

## Record schema

`local_character_key | preferred_name | verified_aliases | first_evidence | evidence_ledger | model | monograph | observed_domains | missing_domains | local_readiness | last_review`

Markdown tables and bounded prose may implement this semantic schema. Unknown values remain unknown; rows cite canonical volume evidence IDs rather than duplicating primary observations.

## Update and routing rule

Update after each eligible volume only when inspected evidence materially affects this responsibility. Preserve stable IDs and historical states. A reviewed domain may record no material change without manufacturing a row. Consequential claims route back to the owning volume reading and forward to the project artifacts named by the series architecture.

## Initial coverage

```yaml
initialized: true
inspected_through_volume: null
row_count: 0
state: READY_FOR_V001
```

The V001 bootstrap probe established page-inspection capability only. It created no analytical record.
