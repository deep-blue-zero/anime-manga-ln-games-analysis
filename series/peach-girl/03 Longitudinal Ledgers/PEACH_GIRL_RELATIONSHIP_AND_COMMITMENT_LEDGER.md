# Directional Relationships and Commitments

This instrument owns directional relationship state and offers, answers, commitments and transitions affecting that state. It separates affection/attraction from relationship labels and actual agreements. It does not own an actor's general personality, circulating propositions or the full argument for a motive. Those homes are linked by ID.

A romantic, friendly, familial, rivalrous, dependent or unresolved relation is classified only when evidence supports it. No pair or relationship type is assumed at initialization.

## Records and allocation

| Type / stable identifier | Required fields |
| --- | --- |
| Directional event `PG-RL-####` | From/to local subject IDs; prior row/version; continuity; represented time/certainty; learned-after frontier; setting/audience; expressed feeling/label; observed conduct; inferred attachment or motive with alternative; what each participant understands; actual transition and consequences; observation refs; claim/version; confidence/basis; correction link |
| Commitment/boundary event `PG-CM-####` | Participants and direction; exact offer/request/limit; answer or no evidenced answer; scope and conditions; knowledge link; acceptance evidence; actual conduct/permission/consequence; status; time/frontier; observations/claim; prior/revision link |
| Current directional view | Ordered pair + temporal/disclosure boundary; active RL/CM versions; private and public descriptions; reciprocity known/unknown; unresolved disagreements |

Commitment states may be `PROPOSED / ACCEPTED_WITH_EVIDENCE / DECLINED / AMBIGUOUS / BREACHED_WITH_EVIDENCE / WITHDRAWN / ENDED`. State the particular commitment and evidence; silence, attraction or the analyst's preferred label does not establish an agreement or breach. Public presentation and private understanding can differ. A statement of exclusivity, inferred expectation and reciprocal commitment must remain separately retrievable.

Direction matters: A→B does not establish B→A. A dyadic record can link both directional events, but cannot erase asymmetric access. A later reciprocal relation does not establish earlier consent or the same prior feeling. Nonromantic intimacy is permitted; explicit romantic evidence cannot be relabeled without a supported reason.

## Evidence, update and history

Allocate monotonically numbered IDs on actual admitted observations; never reuse a retired ID. Each event cites `PG-EV-VNN-####` with witness/page/panel and learned-after frontier. Track action, attributed statement and inference separately, with `HIGH / MODERATE / LOW / UNRESOLVED` support and basis. Unknown participant understanding remains unknown; link `PG-KN` rather than inventing it.

A future VNN transaction appends material changes in affection, affiliation, trust, jealousy, dependency, approach/withdrawal, relationship classification, promises, boundaries, rupture or repair. A source-supported stable relationship can receive an initial event; lack of change alone does not require a new row. Link actor-level choices in `PG-CS`, audience reputation in `PG-RP` and material interpretive arguments in `PG-CL@version`. Record each consequence once in its responsible home.

Original event/offer/answer wording and the then-known frontier remain preserved. Append later transitions or corrections, update only the current projection, and retain prior versions. The unit freeze records the precise current versions before later sources are opened. Later revelations revise the current interpretation through `PG-RV`; they do not rewrite prior prospective feelings or forecast terms.

The sequential closeout records updated/no-material-change status. Bootstrap source-derived relationship, commitment and current-view rows: **0**.
