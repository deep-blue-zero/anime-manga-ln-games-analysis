# Character state and readiness ledger

## Responsibility

Owns observed state changes, local character keys, evidence coverage and bounded model readiness by domain. It does not create global entity IDs or duplicate the operational reconstruction model.

## Record format

`state event ID | local key | source observation refs | prior state | observed change | change kind | new information versus disposition | persistent features | uncertainty; readiness: local key | state/source boundary | contexts | supported domains | missing contexts | counterexamples | validation | model path`

Every future record needs a stable local ID, source/witness and volume boundary, a link to the canonical volume observation, claim class, and explicit uncertainty. No sample rows are treated as evidence.

## Update and ownership rule

Append source-bearing state events; revise current readiness only when an evidence review warrants it, preserving the prior state and reasoning. Leave global IDs null until curation establishes them. The analytical integrator synchronizes this ledger with each closed volume transaction; a reviewed no-material-update is recorded in the volume closure without padding this ledger.

## Initial state — 2026-09-25

`NOT_STARTED`: zero narrative observations and zero substantive records. V01 is only structurally inspected for source usability. No absent phenomenon or character trait is inferred from the empty ledger. First update requires a separately authorized V01 reading.

## V01 accepted records — read 2026-09-25; closure prepared 2026-09-26 UTC

The owner approved the V01 reading after its synopsis revision. Its hash-only locator map is durably retained and byte-verified as recorded in the [source lock](../01%20Source%20Lock%20and%20Inventory/MT_SOURCE_LOCK_AND_INVENTORY.md). The records below are accepted within V01; their interpretations and uncertainties are unchanged. The [current map](../CURRENT_STATE_AND_CORPUS_MAP.md) distinguishes this local closure candidate from pending branch publication and exact-head audit. The bootstrap zero state above remains historical.

All events are bounded to `MT-LNJP-V01` and cite observations in the [accepted V01 reading](../02%20Sequential%20Readings/MT_V01_DEEP_READING.md). Local keys are **not** global character IDs. Each current assessment retains its stated V01 evidential limits; prior zero state above remains historical.

| State event ID / local key | Prior → observed change and kind | Basis / uncertainty |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MT-S-001` / `Rudeus` | Reported isolation and fear → daily magic practice and ability; changed activity/skill, not demonstrated global ethical reform. | `001,003,005`; self-reported prior biography and short experimental series limit causal and population inference. |
| `MT-S-002` / `Rudeus` | Home/garden limit → accompanied trip, then voluntarily steps beyond gate; situational avoidance reduced. | `008`; no clinical diagnosis or proof that every social setting is now safe. |
| `MT-S-003` / `Rudeus` | Protector/teacher role → overrides Sylphie's refusal, recognizes wrong, apologizes, then later imagines shaping her future; conflicting boundary responses. | `009,011–012,015`; recognition and temporary restraint observed, durability untested. |
| `MT-S-004` / `Lilia` | Suspicion/aversion of infant → respect and extreme debt framing after family meeting; belief/relationship revision. | `004,013`; her own earlier employment history and self-blame matter. The proposed future service by Aisha is not Aisha's consent. |
| `MT-S-005` / `Roxy` | Teacher with limited local prospects → recognized village worker, departure for further practice, later reports higher rank and another teaching post. | `006–008,015`; letter is her report, not independently observed offstage experience. |
| `MT-S-006` / `Paul` | Headstrong teacher initially acts on accusation → apologizes and in a later case asks about Sylphie's refusal; partial parenting practice change. | `010–012`; later forced removal `016` is substantial contrary evidence to a generalized noncoercion rule. |
| `MT-S-007` / `Zenith` | Betrayal and contemplated departure → chooses Lilia's continued place and feeds Aisha; chosen care with unresolved religious tension. | `013–014`; her first-person extra supplies reasons but not a durable harmony guarantee. |
| `MT-S-008` / `Sylphie` | Isolated target → initiates friendship/learning, practices silent magic, asserts refusal, remains cautious, protests separation. | `009,011–012,016`; strong observable action, little direct interior narration. |
| `MT-S-009` / `Ghislaine` | New arrival as a sword expert → requests literacy/number instruction as part of exchange. | `016`; her self-account and full instructional practice are not yet present. |

### Current bounded readiness

| Local key | Supported domains through V01 | Missing contexts / standalone model decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Rudeus` | Study/experimental response, failure management, selected family care, conflict rhetoric, fear at gate, some ethical self-correction. | No stable response model across independent contexts, sustained consent practice, employment, equal-power intimacy, or later consequences. **Standalone operational model deferred.** His claim to a numerical mental age is self-description only. |
| `Lilia` | Safety/pay decision, household labor, changed judgment of Rudeus, self-blame in crisis. | Thin access to life outside house and later motherhood. Model deferred. |
| `Roxy` | Adaptive pedagogy, paid work, treatment of error, chosen continued education. | Offstage new post is only letter report; broader relational contexts absent. Model deferred. |
| `Paul` | Sword teaching, mistaken discipline and apology, expressed dependence concern, coercive separation. | Competing motives and untested consequences prevent a general parenting rule. Model deferred. |
| `Zenith` | Faith, family boundary, practical healing/care, response to betrayal, chosen feeding of Aisha. | Extra is a first-person self-account; future stability and work outside house sparsely observed. Model deferred. |
| `Sylphie` | Independent learning request, repeated practice, refusal and avoidance, abandonment protest. | Her developing goals and peer world beyond Rudeus are not sufficiently accessible. Model deferred. |
| `Ghislaine`, `Norn`, `Aisha`, `Rolls` | Limited encounter or represented need/choice only. | No standalone reconstruction warranted; retain local keys without global enrollment. |
